## Testing & Verification Needed

### Priority 1: Companion System Verification
```bash
# Test Steps:
1. Delete save file: rm -f game_state.json.gz
2. Start game: python3 term_dungeon_rpg.py
3. VERIFY: 'P' character (cyan color) appears next to '@' at start
4. VERIFY: Message "X the Guardian joins you as your loyal companion!" appears
5. VERIFY: Companion follows player and fights enemies
6. Press 'R' to restart
7. VERIFY: No crash occurs, new companion spawns
```

### Priority 2: Map Generation Verification
```bash
# Test Steps:
1. Start new game multiple times
2. VERIFY: Each map has completely different layout
3. VERIFY: No cross-shaped corridors
4. VERIFY: Rooms are varied sizes and positions
5. VERIFY: All areas are reachable (no trapped player/enemies)
6. VERIFY: Enemies spawn in reachable locations
```

### Priority 3: Missing Features
```bash
# Portal Generation:
1. VERIFY: 'O' characters (portals) appear in dungeons
2. VERIFY: Stepping on portal teleports player
3. If missing: Add _generate_portals() method to BSP algorithm

# Enemy Verification:
1. VERIFY: No 's' (slime) characters appear
2. VERIFY: 'k' (skeleton) and 'x' (spider) enemies spawn
3. VERIFY: All 4 enemy types have proper stats and behavior
```

   - Test restart functionality (press 'R')

2. **Verify Map Variety**:
   - Generate multiple maps by restarting
   - Confirm each layout is unique
   - Check connectivity and enemy placement

3. **Add Missing Portal Generation**:
